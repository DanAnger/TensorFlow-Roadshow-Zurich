This repository contains material, notebooks, scripts that will eventually be a complete course on Edge Computing and TensorFlow Lite.

The material is divided in sections, each having its own folder.
In each folder you will find a README.md with a table of content and instructions of what you can find in the folder. Here you will find a high level table of contenst that should help you in navigating the material and finding what you need or search.
